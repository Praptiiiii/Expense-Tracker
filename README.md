# Expense-Tracker

This code sets up a simple web-based expense tracker where users can input expense descriptions, select categories, and enter amounts. The entered data is then dynamically added to a summary table without refreshing the page, thanks to the JavaScript handling the form submission and DOM manipulation. The styling ensures the application looks neat and user-friendly.
